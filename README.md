# Medical_diagnosis_system
This project aims to develop a medical diagnosis expert system in C++. The system uses a rule-based knowledge representation technique to emulate the diagnostic decision-making process of a human healthcare provider. It collects symptoms from the user, matches them against a predefined set of rules in the knowledge base, and provides a list of possible medical conditions that correspond to the reported symptoms. The system is designed to support healthcare providers by offering a second opinion and aiding in the initial screening of conditions, thereby facilitating quicker and more informed medical decisions.
